僕は立派な学歴もないけど
いつも君だけのロックンローラー　夢だけは忘れてない

車も中古のオンボロだけど
君となら大気圏も突破できる　火星だって行けちゃうぜ

ダイヤモンドも豪邸もない　おまけにケンカも強くない
でも昔から働き者だし　体だけは丈夫だよ

言葉じゃなんだか　上手く言えないけど
とにかく君とずっといたいんだ

Would you join me? Would you join me?
Would you join me? Would you join me?
Would you join me?　一緒に行こう
Would you join me?　一緒にやろう
Would you join me?　暗い夜を
Would you join me?　笑い飛ばそう

君はスゴイよ　まるでマジシャン
僕のちっぽけな悩みなんて　一瞬で消してしまう
街は雨降り　今日もどしゃ降り　みんなが傘を探してる
僕は君だけのロックンローラー　太陽の歌を唄う

むずかしいことは　よくわからないけど
今やらなくちゃ　いつやるんだ

Would you join me? Would you join me?
Would you join me? Would you join me?
Would you join me?　一緒に行こう
Would you join me?　一緒にやろう
Would you join me?　黒い罠を
Would you join me?　ひっくり返そう

Would you join me? Would you join me?
Would you join me? Would you join me?

Would you join me?　一緒に行こう
Would you join me?　抱きしめあおう
Would you join me?　こんな夜に
Would you join me?　花を咲かそう

Would you join me? Would you join me?
Would you join me? Would you join me?
